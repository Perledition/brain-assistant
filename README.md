## Why not ChatGPT?

This PlugIn is only for question and answer sessions and limited in it's capabilities to generate text for every other prompt. However, Aleph Alpha does not store any information about your requests in detail. Only metadata, like how long the request was and how much time it took, will be stored. It is a german AI manufacturer who needs to be conform with the EU Law.
