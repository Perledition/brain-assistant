# Brain-Assistant

The Obsidian Q&A Plugin with Aleph Alpha AI Integration is a powerful tool that allows you to perform question and answer sessions using your local Obsidian.md files, enhanced by the capabilities of the Aleph Alpha AI. This plugin enhances your knowledge management workflow by enabling you to extract meaningful insights and answers from your notes.

## Features

-   **Local Q&A:** Use your own Obsidian.md notes for Q&A sessions.

-   **Budget control:** Instead of another subscription you can buy a budget of credits, see the remaining budget in your Obsidian directly.

## Why not ChatGPT?

This PlugIn is only for question and answer sessions and limited in it's capabilities to generate text for every other prompt. However, Aleph Alpha does not store any information about your requests in detail. Only metadata, like how long the request was and how much time it took, will be stored. It is a german AI manufacturer who needs to be conform with the EU Law.

## How to use

**1. Create an Aleph Alpha Account:** Create your Account under https://app.aleph-alpha.com/. You will have 2 free credits to start with. You need to buy more credits with a credit card. But the pricing in quite fair. (50 credits for around 10â‚¬ and one request cost abround 0.001-0.002 credits)

**2. Create an API Token:** Once logged in you need to create an API Token in your profile and copy that to the obsidian plugin settings.

**3. Finalize Setup:** You need to add the full path to your obsidian vault in the settings as well and I recommend to enter the budget from aleph alpha as well which can be found under "buy credits" in your aleph alpha account - but the budget is optional.

**4. Open the Chat:** You will find a ribbon icon on the left which will open the chat for you. I recommend to restart Obsidian once before you finally get started.s
